# PasswordManager (Java with MongoDB)

## Overview
This Password Manager is a personal side project Java application designed to help you manage your passwords and sensitive data efficiently. 
It utilizes MongoDB as the backend database to store and retrieve your encrypted information, ensuring both convenience and security.

## Current Features
- **Command Line Interface:** Currently, the program is run from command line.

- **Command Line Detection:** Our program intelligently detects whether it's running in an actual command line or an integrated development environment (IDE). It hides passwords on the actual command line to enhance security and issues a warning if it detects an IDE environment.

- **Encryption:** Your data is encrypted before it is stored in MongoDB, providing an extra layer of security and decrypted when retrieved.

- **Secure Login:** Use a master password to access your password manager, adding an extra level of protection.

- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find your login details using your registered username.

## Security Note

This password manager is a part of my ongoing learning journey, where I am continually expanding my knowledge of security, including encryption techniques and secure interactions with the database. While I am dedicated to enhancing the security of this application, it's important to acknowledge that it may still contain potential security issues as I actively learn and implement best practices.

Please be aware that, like any educational project, there may be aspects of the codebase that are evolving as I gain deeper insights into security measures.

Your feedback and suggestions for improving the security of this password manager are highly appreciated as they contribute to my ongoing learning and the enhancement of this application's security.
